# Assignment 15
- Create a `int` variable with `int variable`.
- Create a variable that is a pointer to the `int` int variable with int `*ptr = &variable`.

Use the following variable references to replace the `x` in the appropriate print statements below:

- `*ptr`.
- `variable`.
- `ptr`.
- `&variable`.

Print statements:

- `printf("The value of int variable is: %d\n", x);`
- `printf("The value of the pointer to the int variable is: %d\n", x);`
- `printf("The memory address of the int variable is: %d\n", x);`
- `printf("The value held at the memory location that the pointer is pointing to is: %d\n", x);`
