# Assignment 24
For this exercise we're going to build a C program that executes syscalls! We've already learned basically everything we need to know in C
up until this point to accomplish this. We are going to keep it simple and we're going to use the `open()` syscall only here. It should be
noted that technically we are not making syscalls directly in user programs, but instead are using wrapper functions defined in libc for
our purposes.
