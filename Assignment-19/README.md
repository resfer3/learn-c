# Assignment 19
Initialize a `char` pointer variable. Use the `malloc()` function to allocate memory for a char array
by assigning the result of `malloc()` to your pointer. Your program should check that the memory was
indeed allocated and if not, print an error message and exit with code `1`. Make sure your allocation size
is a multiple of the `char` data type by using the `sizeof()` function so the code is portable.
Google best practices for using `malloc()`. Don't forget to use `free()` to free the memory space before
exiting the program if succesful.

Print a success or failure message to the terminal.
