# Assignment 07
Prompt the user for A, B, and C values and then use those values to determine the value of 'X' using the Quadratic Formula.

Extra Credit: Build in a mechanism which checks the solution by plugging it back into the formula and seeing if it equals 0.
Use if control flow to instruct the user to double check all solutions which aren't confirmed (a lot won't be confirmed
since they'll be truncated decimals).
