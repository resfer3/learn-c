# learn-c
This repo is a collection of assignments and mini-programs in my pursuit of learning C

I noticed, being on a mac at the moment :(, that the last assignments are dealing more with the linux landscape of things.
Because of my desire of trying a mac system, unfortunately, I can't do anything linux related within the system. Soon I'll have
a linux space again, but until then I gotta find other projects or some other way of learning c.

- Every assignment comes from this [repo](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C)
