# Assignment 18

What is the difference? Figure out why we need to terminate our array with '\0'. How did we print letters with char values in our array being integers?.

- We need to terminate with \0 if it's an array of characters to make sure that's the end of the string.
- It prints letters because each integer directly translates to ascii

Extra Credit: Try printing the array in both cases with puts() instead of printf(), notice anything different?

- It prints a newline for you automatically when it reaches the end of the string, possibly safer to use puts().
