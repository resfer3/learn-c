# Assignment 23
Create a simple structure of your choice. Mine will have a single member, an int called integer. Do not create an instance of the struct yet.
Declare a pointer variable that points to your struct. This pointer doesn't actually point to anything yet because there are no instances
of the first struct. Create an instance of the struct. Now initiliaze your pointer to point to the struct instance.

Finally, assign values to the integer member of your original struct in three ways:

- assign a value by using standard dot-notation of your instance and then print the value.
- assign a value by using standard dot-notation for the pointer initialized to the instance and then print the value.
- assign a value by using the ->(arrow notation) indirect membership operator between the pointer name and the structure member and
then print the value.
