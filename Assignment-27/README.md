# Assignment 27
Now that we've got some more syscall experience under our belt, we're going to take a step back and actually look at how
syscalls are implemented. We're going to create a malicious shared library to hook some syscalls. We are getting very naughty.

We will be using these excellent blog posts:
- https://ketansingh.net/overview-on-linux-userland-rootkits/
- https://blog.netspi.com/function-hooking-part-i-hooking-shared-library-function-calls-in-linux/
as our guides, I recommend reading through these posts at least twice.
