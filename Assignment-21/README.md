- employee ID number,
- last 4 digits of their SSN, and
- title.

Design a second struct which will store two employees as members. The employees will be structures of the type of your first struct. Inside of main(), prompt the user to enter each employee's credentials and store them. Finally, print the employee's credentials to the terminal.
